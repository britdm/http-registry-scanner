# registry-scanner

alpha repository

Scripts are created to scan an insecure private Docker registry at port `5000` with the basic authentication from `brittanym/registry:2.0`.

## future goals

- Enable input for variables `registry url`, `username`, and `password`.
- Binary files to simplify installation and use of the scanner.
